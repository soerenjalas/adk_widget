Provide ADK appearance intensities as plotly widget. Also shown is an approximation of the electron kinetic energy under the assumption of linear laser polarization, conservation of canonical momentum and ionisation occuring at the appearance intensity. Additionally, we assume non-relativistic motion, an assumption which will not hold for all ionization states.
